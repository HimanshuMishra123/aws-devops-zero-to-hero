Certainly! Here are the detailed notes on the AWS Cloud Formation Templates (CFT):

Introduction to AWS Cloud Formation Templates (CFT)
- CFT is a service provided by AWS that allows you to create, update, and manage AWS infrastructure in a declarative way using code.
- CFT implements the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which means you can define your infrastructure in a template file and then deploy it consistently across different environments.
- The key difference between CFT and AWS CLI is that CFT follows the IaC principles, while CLI is more of an imperative approach to managing AWS resources.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Principles
- IaC tools act as a middleware between the user and the cloud provider.
- Users submit declarative and versioned templates (e.g., YAML or JSON files) to the IaC tool.
- The IaC tool then translates the template into the cloud provider's API calls to create, update, and manage the resources.
- IaC tools can support single cloud providers (e.g., CFT for AWS) or multiple cloud providers (e.g., Terraform).

Components of AWS Cloud Formation Templates
1. **Template Structure**: CFT templates can be written in either YAML or JSON format. The template consists of the following main sections:
   - `AWSTemplateFormatVersion`: Specifies the version of the template format.
   - `Description`: A brief description of the template.
   - `Parameters`: Defines the input parameters for the template.
   - `Conditions`: Defines the conditions under which resources are created, updated, or deleted.
   - `Resources`: Defines the AWS resources to be created and their properties.
   - `Outputs`: Defines the values to be returned when you view the stack's properties.

2. **Resource Definitions**: Each resource in the template is defined with a logical ID, resource type, and properties. For example:

   ```yaml
   Resources:
     MyVPC:
       Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
       Properties:
         CidrBlock: 10.0.0.0/16
         EnableDnsHostnames: true
         EnableDnsSupport: true
         InstanceTenancy: default
   ```

3. **Functions and Intrinsic Functions**: CFT provides a set of functions that can be used within the template to perform various operations, such as:
   - `Ref`: Returns the value of the specified parameter or resource.
   - `Fn::GetAtt`: Returns the value of a resource attribute.
   - `Fn::FindInMap`: Returns the value corresponding to keys in a two-level map.

4. **Stacks and Stack Operations**: A stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. You can perform the following stack operations:
   - Create a stack: Deploy a new stack based on the template.
   - Update a stack: Update an existing stack by changing the template.
   - Delete a stack: Delete all the resources in the stack.
   - Detect drift: Detect any differences between the resources in the stack and the expected template definitions.

5. **Cross-Stack References**: CFT allows you to reference resources across different stacks, enabling you to build complex, interconnected infrastructures.

6. **Nested Stacks**: CFT supports the use of nested stacks, where a resource in one stack can include another stack. This allows you to break down your infrastructure into reusable components.

Advantages of using AWS Cloud Formation Templates
- **Consistent and Repeatable Deployments**: CFT allows you to define your infrastructure in a declarative way, ensuring that your deployments are consistent across different environments.
- **Versioning and Change Management**: CFT templates can be stored in version control systems like Git, allowing you to track changes and roll back to previous versions if needed.
- **Drift Detection**: CFT can detect any differences between the resources in the stack and the expected template definitions, helping you identify and fix any infrastructure drift.
- **Reusability and Modularity**: CFT supports the use of nested stacks and cross-stack references, enabling you to build reusable and modular infrastructure components.

Practical Example: Creating a Simple EC2 Instance using AWS Cloud Formation Template
1. Create a new CFT template in YAML format:

   ```yaml
   AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
   Description: Create a simple EC2 instance

   Resources:
     MyEC2Instance:
       Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
       Properties:
         ImageId: ami-0c94755bb95c71c99 # Amazon Linux 2 AMI
         InstanceType: t2.micro
         KeyName: my-key-pair # Make sure you have a key pair in your AWS account
         SecurityGroupIds:
           - !Ref MySecurityGroup
   
     MySecurityGroup:
       Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
       Properties:
         GroupDescription: Allow SSH access
         SecurityGroupIngress:
           - IpProtocol: tcp
             FromPort: 22
             ToPort: 22
             CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
   
   Outputs:
     InstanceId:
       Description: InstanceId of the EC2 instance
       Value: !Ref MyEC2Instance
   ```

2. Save the file as `ec2-instance.yaml`.
3. Deploy the stack using the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-ec2-stack --template-body file://ec2-instance.yaml
   ```

4. Monitor the stack creation process using the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name my-ec2-stack
   ```

5. Once the stack is created, you can find the instance ID in the Outputs section.

This is a simple example, but CFT can be used to create much more complex infrastructures, including VPCs, subnets, load balancers, databases, and more. The key benefit is that you can manage your entire infrastructure as code, making it easier to version, reuse, and automate your deployments.
