# AWS CodePipeline
AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release pipelines. It helps you to build, test, and deploy your application every time there is a code change.

## Key Features of AWS CodePipeline:
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): CodePipeline helps you implement a CI/CD workflow by automating the build, test, and deploy stages of your release process.
Integrations with AWS Services: CodePipeline seamlessly integrates with other AWS services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and many more, allowing you to create an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline.
Visual Workflow: CodePipeline provides a visual representation of your release pipeline, making it easy to understand and manage the different stages of your deployment process.
Versioning and Traceability: CodePipeline keeps track of all the changes in your pipeline, allowing you to easily revert to a previous state if needed.
Scalability and Reliability: As a fully managed service, CodePipeline scales automatically to handle your pipeline needs, and provides high availability and durability.

## How does AWS CodePipeline work? 
Source Stage: This is the starting point of your pipeline, where you define the source of your application code, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, or AWS CodeCommit.
Build Stage: In this stage, you define the steps to build your application, such as compiling the code, running unit tests, and creating a deployable artifact (e.g., a Docker image or a deployment package).
Deploy Stage: This stage is responsible for deploying your application to the target environment, such as EC2, ECS, or Lambda.
Additional Stages: Depending on your needs, you can add additional stages to your pipeline, such as testing, approval, or manual intervention.


## Comparison with Jenkins
While Jenkins is a popular open-source CI/CD tool, AWS CodePipeline offers several advantages-
Managed Service: CodePipeline is a fully managed service, which means you don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure, scaling, or availability. This can significantly reduce the operational overhead compared to self-hosting Jenkins.
Tight Integration with AWS Services: CodePipeline seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, making it easier to create an end-to-end CI/CD workflow on the AWS platform.
Scalability and Reliability: As a managed service, CodePipeline can automatically scale to handle your pipeline needs, and it provides high availability and durability.
Visual Workflow: CodePipeline's visual representation of the pipeline makes it easier to understand and manage the different stages of your deployment process.

## Benefits of Jenkins over AWS CodePipeline-
Flexibility and Customization
On-Premises Deployment
Community and Ecosystem
Portability
Cost Optimization
Existing Skills and Experience

**important comparison**: Jenkins is typically responsible for two actions one is continuous integration and the second thing is to invoke The Continuous delivery.(it doesn't do CD just invokes it).
