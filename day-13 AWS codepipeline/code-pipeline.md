# AWS CodePipeline
AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release pipelines. It helps you to build, test, and deploy your application every time there is a code change.

## Key Features of AWS CodePipeline:
**Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** CodePipeline helps you implement a CI/CD workflow by automating the build, test, and deploy stages of your release process.<br/>
**Integrations with AWS Services:** CodePipeline seamlessly integrates with other AWS services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and many more, allowing you to create an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline.<br/>
**Visual Workflow:** CodePipeline provides a visual representation of your release pipeline, making it easy to understand and manage the different stages of your deployment process.<br/>
**Versioning and Traceability:** CodePipeline keeps track of all the changes in your pipeline, allowing you to easily revert to a previous state if needed.<br/>
**Scalability and Reliability:** As a fully managed service, CodePipeline scales automatically to handle your pipeline needs, and provides high availability and durability.<br/>

### AWS CodePipeline Overview

#### Key Components
1. **AWS CodeCommit/GitHub/GitLab:**
   - Acts as the source control repository.
   - CodeCommit is AWS-managed, but GitHub and GitLab are often preferred for their features.

2. **AWS CodeBuild:** (to implement all the stage as shown in image)
   - Managed build service for compiling code, running tests, and creating deployment-ready packages.
   - Additional Stages: Depending on your needs, you can add additional stages to your pipeline, such as testing, approval, or manual intervention.<br/>
   - You can also write custom scripts as well and ignore AWS code build service completely but mostly the followed approach is that people use AWS code build for CI thing.

3. **AWS CodeDeploy:**(take care of CD part)
   - Automates application deployment to Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, or on-premises servers.
   - Manages the continuous delivery (CD) aspect.

4. **AWS CodePipeline:**
   - Orchestrates the CI/CD process, integrating with various AWS services and third-party tools.
   - Manages the flow from code changes to deployment.

### Comparison: AWS CodePipeline vs. Jenkins

#### Management and Maintenance
- **AWS CodePipeline:**
  - Fully managed by AWS, reducing the need for infrastructure management.
  - AWS handles scaling, maintenance, and monitoring.

- **Jenkins:**
  - Requires setup and maintenance of Jenkins servers and agents.
  - Involves managing updates, plugins, and scaling infrastructure.

#### Flexibility and Portability
- **AWS CodePipeline:**
  - Tightly integrated with the AWS ecosystem, leading to less portability if moving away from AWS.

- **Jenkins:**
  - Platform-agnostic and open-source, offering flexibility across different cloud providers or on-premises setups.

#### Cost
- **AWS CodePipeline:**
  - Operates on a pay-as-you-go model, which can be costly if not managed efficiently.

- **Jenkins:**
  - Open-source, but there are costs related to infrastructure and maintenance.

#### Integration and Ecosystem
- **AWS CodePipeline:**
  - Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services.
  - Limited third-party integrations compared to Jenkins.

- **Jenkins:**
  - Rich ecosystem of plugins, supporting extensive integration with various tools and platforms.

#### Use Cases
- **AWS CodePipeline:**
  - Best suited for organizations committed to the AWS ecosystem and looking for a managed CI/CD solution.

- **Jenkins:**
  - Ideal for organizations requiring a customizable, cross-platform CI/CD solution, especially in multi-cloud or hybrid environments.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages of AWS CodePipeline
- Managed service, reducing operational overhead.
- Scalability and reliability managed by AWS.
- Suitable for organizations fully utilizing AWS services.

#### Disadvantages of AWS CodePipeline
- Higher costs compared to open-source alternatives like Jenkins.
- Limited to AWS, lacking portability for multi-cloud or on-premises strategies.
- Less flexibility in customization compared to Jenkins.

#### Advantages of Jenkins
- Open-source, offering cost-effective solutions.
- Highly flexible and customizable with a rich plugin ecosystem.
- Portable across different environments, including cloud, on-premises, and multi-cloud setups.

#### Disadvantages of Jenkins
- Requires manual setup and maintenance, including infrastructure management.
- May involve higher operational overhead compared to managed services like AWS CodePipeline.

### Practical Application
- **AWS CodePipeline** can be set up with **GitHub repositories**, using **CodeBuild** for the CI process.
- Organizations may opt for AWS CodePipeline for simplicity and integration with AWS services, while others may prefer Jenkins for its flexibility and open-source nature.



**important comparison**: Jenkins is typically responsible for implementing continuous integration and invoking The Continuous delivery.(it doesn't implement CD just invokes it).<br/>
whereas AWS code pipeline takes the responsibility of invoking continuous integration(aws code build) and invoking continuous delivery(code deploy).<br/>
AWS code pipeline can even invoke the jenkins build as well instead of aws code build.
